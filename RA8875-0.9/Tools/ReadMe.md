The GenerateFonts tool is built by myself and is used to create the fonts for my custom fork of the RA8875 library. <br>
For a video guild on how to use the GenerateFonts tool vist my youtube page at "Add link here..."

The basic instructions are:
- Choose the font, size and style.
- Click start.
- Click Options and click Auto crop all (this will remove the excess padding around each character and automaticlly update the y position offset of the character.
- Click the close icon (x).
- Your font is located in the fontFiles folder.

You can also edit each character by clicking on the preview on the character.
- Right click is to delete a pixel, avoid using this unless you understand the logic of the tool, in short you should always remove an entire row or column, right clicking a deleted pixel will add it back.
- Left clicking a pixel toogles between a white and balck pixel.
- Click Options save to save your changes to the given character you edited, or just click the close icon (x) to not save the changes.
- You can also auto crop the given character in the editor.
- There is also the option to resize the character, this add a row or column to the character.


Note: The auto cropper works by removing any all white columns or rows until it hits a black pixel in the adjacent row or column.
You can also load an exiting font file generated by the tool to edit the characters if required, but make sure the text structure of the file is the same, it reads the main header at the top of the file and the headers above each character set, so don't delete them.


ConvertBmpToXbmp is another tool built by myself, its rather straigh forward to use, you can convert a mono chrome bmp to a xbmp array, which is in the standard 8-bit hex array format, with the rendering starting from array zero, bit 7.
The tool can also convert 16-bit bmp and 24-bit bmp to a 565 color arrays.
You can also input a xbmp array into the text box and click load text to convert a xbmp array back into a mono chrome bmp.
I need to test the load file as i am sure as i write this that it ony support xbmp files, which have not been adjusted in terms of text formatting.
